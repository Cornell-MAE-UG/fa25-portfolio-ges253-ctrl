## Project Description

For this project, I was tasked with designing a frame/mechanism within a 2D space of 150cm by 50cm to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. The design constraints included:

- A rigid bar of fixed length (chosen based on optimal geometry)
- Three pin supports, with two mounted on the ground
- A linear actuator selected from an online catalog, using only maximum force values

My approach involved:

1. **Component Selection:** I analyzed various actuator options to maximize lifting force, and chose a bar length that balanced reach and mechanical advantage within the design space.
2. **Support Placement:** I strategically positioned the two ground-mounted supports to provide stability and maximize the vertical lift, while the third support allowed for controlled movement of the bar.
3. **Mechanism Configuration:** I modeled several frame layouts, simulating the kinematics to determine which arrangement allowed the bar to lift the heaviest load to the greatest height. I ensured all supports, bar, and actuator were treated as perfectly rigid for analysis.
4. **Optimization:** Using geometric and force calculations, I iterated on the design to find the configuration that achieved the highest possible lift and weight capacity, given the actuator's maximum force and the constraints of the design space.

The final design featured an optimized placement of supports and actuator, enabling the mechanism to efficiently convert actuator force into vertical lift. This project strengthened my skills in mechanical design, kinematic analysis, and practical optimization under real-world constraints.
