## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am an aspiring Mechanical Engineer, studying at Cornell University. I have developed my engineering skills through classes and extracurricular activities throughout my time as a student. In particular, I have fostered creative problem solving and collaborative development habits through my student-run project team, CUAir. I am currently a second year student expected to graduate in May 2028.

Aside from engineering, I am interested in learning the spanish language and plan to receive a minor in the study. I was born in Toronto, Canada, and grew up in Westchester, New York. I went skiing every weekend in the winters as a kid and now try to get to the mountain whenever possible. Additionally, some of my other hobbies include playing chess, listening to music, working out, and playing with my dog.
