## About Me

<<<<<<< HEAD
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am an aspiring Mechanical Engineer, studying at Cornell University. I have developed my engineering skills through classes and extracurricular activities throughout my time as a student. In particular, I have fostered creative problem solving and collaborative development habits through my student-run project team, CUAir. I am currently a second year student expected to graduate in May 2028.

Aside from engineering, I am interested in learning the spanish language and plan to receive a minor in the study. I was born in Toronto, Canada, and grew up in Westchester, New York. I went skiing every weekend in the winters as a kid and now try to get to the mountain whenever possible. Additionally, some of my other hobbies include playing chess, listening to music, working out, and playing with my dog.

I have developed my engineering skills through classes and extracurriculars. In particular, my student-run project team, CUAir, has aided me in fostering strong problem-solving and organizational habits in the realm of engineering production and testing.

Aside from engineering, I enjoy learning about the spanish language, and plan to receive a minor in the study. I also grew up skiing every weekend in the winters, and am now involved in the executive board of the Cornell Ski Club as the events and development coordinator. Besides that, some of my other hobbies include playing chess, listening to music, working out, and playing with my dog.
